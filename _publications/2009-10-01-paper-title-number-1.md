excerpt: 'In view of the process characteristics of CNC machining of crankshafts, a solution is proposed for developing crankshaft grinding software on the Siemens 840D sl system. Based on the development principle of the Sinumerik OPERATE software package, a mathematical model for crankshaft grinding control was established. Using Visual Studio 2008 and Qt Designer as programming tools, and combining C++ and Qt languages, crankshaft grinding software was developed and embedded into the 840D sl CNC system through the Sinumerik Operate package. Finally, the tool path simulation module of OpenGL was employed to conduct simulation and verification of the crankpin grinding process.'

Abstract:
In view of the process characteristics of CNC machining of crankshafts, a solution is proposed for developing crankshaft grinding software on the Siemens 840D sl system. Based on the development principle of the Sinumerik OPERATE software package, a mathematical model for crankshaft grinding control was established. Using Visual Studio 2008 and Qt Designer as programming tools, and combining C++ and Qt languages, crankshaft grinding software was developed and embedded into the 840D sl CNC system through the Sinumerik Operate package. Finally, the tool path simulation module of OpenGL was employed to conduct simulation and verification of the crankpin grinding process.
