During my Masterâ€™s studies at Beijing Information Science and Technology University, I independently led a project focused on the design and development of a fully automated fruit smoothie processing machine. The system was engineered to process three types of frozen fruits in combination with fruit syrup and water, according to predefined ratios and parameters,to produce a freshly blended smoothie with consistent quality. My responsibilities have included:
* Completed mechanical design and manufacture; machined components in the lab and assembled the prototype.
* Developed control programs and implemented automation using microcontrollers.
* Conducted experiments to optimize fruit formulations and determine feasible smoothie menus.
